# Algorithms

Unfortunately, this repo will not be well documented.  Algorithms can be found in `lib`, tests can be found in either `spec` or `test` (depending on if it's in Ruby or JavaScript).  I write tests for every algorithm (TDD is awesome), so you can generally get a good description of each algorithm by looking at the tests.
